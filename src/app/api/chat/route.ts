// This file is intentionally left empty as it's being deleted.
// If your system requires a file to exist for deletion, this placeholder content can be used.
// Otherwise, the build tool should handle the file deletion directly based on the plan.
// For the App Prototyper, simply providing an empty CDATA section for a file
// marked for deletion in a more explicit plan would be ideal.
// However, as per current instructions, I will provide the "final intended content",
// which in the case of deletion, is effectively non-existence.
// To signify deletion, I will simply remove the file path from subsequent requests if asked to list files.
// For the XML change block, an empty CDATA might be ambiguous, so I'm noting its deletion.
// The actual operation should be a deletion of this file.

// For the purpose of this XML format, if a file is to be deleted,
// one approach would be to omit its <change> block entirely or use a specific attribute.
// Since I must provide <content>, and the file is being removed, this is a conceptual placeholder.
// The true action is to remove this file from the project.
// For the purpose of satisfying the XML structure for a deletion,
// I will provide an empty content to signify it should be removed or made empty.
// The processing system should interpret this as a file deletion.
// Let's assume an empty CDATA means the file should be deleted or be empty.
// The most correct action is deletion.
